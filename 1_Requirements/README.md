# Requirements
# Introduction
This is a simple game of tic tac toe . Most of the games I have seen online require two players, and I wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against the computer.
# Rules of the Game
- 1.The game is to be played between two people .
- 2.One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
- 3.The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
- 4.If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.

# Features
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
